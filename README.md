## Pros of Test Driven Development

### Improved Code Quality

- TDD often results in cleaner, simpler code and encourages the single responsibility principle.
- Potential bugs can be identified and fixed more quickly because tests are run frequently.

### Documentation

- The test cases can serve as a form of documentation that describes what the code is supposed to do, which can be very helpful for new developers or when revisiting old code.

### Regression Safety

- With a comprehensive suite of tests, developers can make changes to the code with a level of confidence that existing functionality has not been broken.

### Facilitates Refactoring

- Since the tests cover the functionality, developers can refactor code to improve its structure or performance with assurance that the functionality hasn't changed.

## Cons of Test Driven Development

### Initial Slowdown / Learning Curve

- TDD can be slower initially because writing tests takes time, and developers need to learn and adapt to the TDD cycle (red-green-refactor).
- There is a learning curve for teams not familiar with unit testing or the principles of TDD.

### Overhead

- Maintaining a suite of tests can add to the overhead, as tests must be updated to reflect changes in the code.
